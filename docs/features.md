# Unified AI Context Management Feature Set for "Context"

This comprehensive feature set combines the best ideas from both documents to create a powerful AI context orchestrator for VS Code. These features will help developers provide rich, targeted context to LLMs while maintaining control over what information is shared.

## 1. Flexible Context Group Management

### 1.1 User-Defined Context Groups
- **Named Bundles**: Create and save named collections of files, folders, or code snippets that logically belong together (e.g., "Auth", "Database", "UI Components")
- **Persistent Configuration**: Store these groups between sessions in plugin settings or a configuration file
- **Quick Commands**: Add files/snippets to groups via commands like "Add current file to group..." or "Create group from selection..."
- **One-Click Insert**: Insert an entire group into the prompt with a single command (e.g., `@auth-group`)

### 1.2 Smart and Dynamic Groups
- **Pattern-Based Groups**: Automatically maintain groups based on folder structure or glob patterns (e.g., `src/auth/**`)
- **Symbol-Based Groups**: Automatically group files that define or reference a particular symbol
- **Recent Edits Group**: Maintain a group of files changed in the last X commits or time period
- **Open Tabs Shortcut**: Quickly include all currently open editor tabs in the context

## 2. Granular Content Selection and Summaries

### 2.1 Partial File Management
- **Snippet Selection**: Highlight specific sections of code to include instead of entire files
- **Line Range Selection**: Select ranges of lines to form snippets that can be stored in groups
- **In-Editor Extraction**: Add highlighted portions directly to the context from the editor

### 2.2 Hierarchical Summaries
- **Auto-Generated Summaries**: Generate concise summaries of files using AST parsing or LLM assistance
- **Multi-Level Detail**: Start with high-level summaries, then drill down to more detail as needed:
  - Level 1: Short summary of what a file does
  - Level 2: Class/function signatures or outlines
  - Level 3: Detailed implementation
- **Project Structure Maps**: Create "mini-maps" of project structure for high-level context
- **Summary Tooltips**: Show quick summaries in file explorer tooltips for context selection

## 3. Automated Retrieval and Search

### 3.1 Symbol-Based Lookup
- **Language Server Integration**: Fetch definitions and references for symbols using VS Code's Language Server Protocol
- **Call Graph Awareness**: Build a lightweight call graph to understand function relationships
- **One-Click Symbol Context**: Gather all information about a symbol (definition, references, callers, callees) with one click

### 3.2 Search-Based Retrieval
- **Keyword/Regex Search**: Run searches for keywords or patterns across the codebase
- **Hybrid Ranking**: Combine text search with relevance ranking (TF-IDF, BM25) to find most relevant snippets
- **Selective Embeddings**: Optional semantic search via on-demand embeddings for more accurate matching
- **Symbol Indexing**: Maintain an index of symbols for quick lookups and fuzzy matching

## 4. IDE Integration

### 4.1 Problems and Diagnostics
- **Error Context**: Automatically include errors and warnings from the Problems panel
- **Lint and Compilation Feedback**: Gather relevant lint or compilation errors, especially when debugging

### 4.2 Debug and Runtime Information
- **Console Output**: Include recent output from Debug Console or Terminal
- **Stack Traces**: Parse and include stack traces, automatically gathering referenced files/functions
- **Runtime Data**: Capture logs, test results, or coverage data during debugging sessions

### 4.3 Version Control Context
- **Commits and Diffs**: Include recent commits, diffs, or changes to provide historical context
- **PR Context**: Gather PR titles, descriptions, and discussions for branch-specific context
- **Change History**: Show what changed and potentially broke the code

## 5. Advanced Analysis Features

### 5.1 Program Slicing
- **Backward Slicing**: Gather only the statements that can affect a particular line or variable
- **Forward Slicing**: Show code affected by potential changes to functions or variables
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Identify how data moves through the application

### 5.2 Dependency and Call Graphs
- **Visual Call Graphs**: Display call relationships between functions with options to include in context
- **Interactive Exploration**: Click through a function's call chain to select relevant context
- **Dependency Visualization**: Show module dependencies to understand broader code relationships

## 6. Context Management UI

### 6.1 AI Context Panel
- **Dedicated Sidebar**: Display a panel showing all content that will be sent to the LLM
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Reorder, add, or remove items from the context
- **Collapsible Views**: Expand or collapse file/snippet views based on relevance
- **Token Usage Gauge**: Display token count with warnings when approaching limits

### 6.2 Context Preview
- **Live Preview**: Show exactly what will be sent to the LLM before sending
- **Truncation Options**: Provide different summarization options if context exceeds token limits
- **Context Logging**: Keep a record of which files and snippets were used in each interaction

## 7. Validation and Feedback Loops

### 7.1 Response Validation
- **Reference Checking**: Verify if the LLM references non-existent functions or variables
- **Compile/Test Integration**: Optionally test AI suggestions by running compilation or tests
- **Iterative Improvement**: If the LLM seems confused, suggest additional context to include

### 7.2 Adaptive Context
- **Context Refinement**: Based on the LLM's response, suggest additional files or snippets to include
- **Self-Serve Mechanism**: Allow the LLM to request specific additional information when needed

## 8. Performance and Privacy

### 8.1 Efficient Implementation
- **Background Indexing**: Parse and index the project without blocking the editor
- **Incremental Updates**: Update indexes and summaries when files change
- **Cached Analysis**: Store analysis results to avoid repeated computation

### 8.2 Privacy Controls
- **Local Processing**: Keep code indexing and analysis on the user's machine
- **Selective Sharing**: Only send user-approved code to remote LLMs
- **Token Optimization**: Prioritize important context when token limits are a concern

## 9. User Experience Enhancements

### 9.1 Minimal Friction
- **One-Click Actions**: Provide quick actions throughout the UI for adding content to context
- **Smart Defaults**: Automatically gather relevant context based on cursor position or current task
- **Context-Aware Commands**: Offer commands like "Add relevant files to context" that do the heavy lifting

### 9.2 Saved Presets and Export Options
- **Context Presets**: Save particular curated contexts for common scenarios
- **Quick Loading**: Rapidly load saved contexts for similar questions or debugging sessions
- **Shareable Configurations**: Export and share context configurations with team members
- **File Packaging**: Export selected context as a zip file for sharing or archiving
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copy formatted context directly to clipboard for pasting into any LLM interface
- **Template Export**: Export context with customizable templates for different LLM platforms

## Implementation Strategy

A practical development roadmap might follow these phases:

1. **Foundation (Phase 1)**: 
   - Basic context panel UI
   - Manual context groups
   - File and snippet selection
   - Integration with Problems panel and console output

2. **Enhanced Retrieval (Phase 2)**:
   - Language server integration for symbol lookup
   - Basic search functionality
   - File summaries and hierarchical viewing
   - Git integration

3. **Advanced Features (Phase 3)**:
   - Call graph visualization
   - Program slicing
   - Dynamic runtime analysis
   - Adaptive context suggestions

This unified approach combines user control with intelligent automation, helping developers provide precisely the context needed for accurate and helpful AI assistance with minimal effort.
