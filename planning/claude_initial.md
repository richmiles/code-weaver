Based on the documentation you've shared about Codeweaver, I'll help you think through how to approach building the WebSocket server, which is a core component of your architecture.

Before implementing, let's establish a clear plan for the WebSocket server. According to your documentation, this server will:

1. Act as a centralized state manager
2. Broadcast updates to all connected clients
3. Handle file system read operations
4. Track and share real-time client connections
5. Communicate with the MCP server to send contexts

Here's what I recommend for your first steps:

## Initial Planning Steps

1. **Define your data models and interfaces**
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for your context data structures
   - Define message types for client-server communication
   - Design the state management structure

2. **Set up the project structure**
   - Initialize a new Node.js project with TypeScript
   - Set up your development environment with proper tooling
   - Create a folder structure that supports your architectural needs

3. **Start with a minimal viable implementation**
   - Begin with basic connection handling and a simple state object
   - Implement event handlers for core operations
   - Create a message protocol for client-server communication

4. **Plan for testing**
   - Set up unit tests for your core functionality
   - Create a simple client for manual testing

## Technical Considerations

- **WebSocket Library**: Consider using a library like `ws` or `socket.io` depending on your needs
- **State Management**: Think about how to structure your in-memory state and whether you'll need persistence
- **File System Access**: Plan how to safely handle file operations
- **Error Handling**: Design a robust error handling strategy for network and file system operations
- **Authentication**: Consider how clients will authenticate with the server

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or would you prefer guidance on a specific aspect of the WebSocket server implementation?
