Okay, based on the `design.md` and `features.md`, here's a breakdown of the *very first things* you should focus on before writing any WebSocket server implementation code:

1.  **Define the Core Data Structures (Interfaces):**
    *   **Why:** The WebSocket server's primary job is managing and syncing state (context data). You need a crystal-clear definition of *what* this data looks like before you can build logic around it.
    *   **Action:** Create the initial TypeScript interfaces based on `design.md`. Focus on the core entities mentioned:
        *   `ContextGroup` (name, description, list of items)
        *   `ContextItem` (could be a file path, a snippet ID, a substructure reference)
        *   `Snippet` (ID, name, description, content, source file/range)
        *   `FileInfo` (path, size, modification date, language type, maybe substructures if planning early)
        *   `ClientInfo` (ID, type like 'vscode', 'browser', connection status)
        *   `ServerState` (the overall structure holding all context groups, snippets, connected clients, etc.)
    *   **Consider:** Keep the "Multi-User Ready" note in mind – maybe add optional `ownerId` or `permissions` fields even if unused initially. Versioning these interfaces from the start is also wise.

2.  **Define the WebSocket Communication Protocol (Message Types/Events):**
    *   **Why:** How will clients and the server talk? You need to define the "language" they'll use – the specific messages (events) and their expected data payloads.
    *   **Action:** List the essential WebSocket messages needed for the initial functionality. Examples based on the design:
        *   *Client -> Server:* `register_client`, `request_initial_state`, `create_context_group`, `add_item_to_group`, `request_file_content`, `save_snippet`, `get_connected_clients`
        *   *Server -> Client(s):* `initial_state_snapshot`, `state_update` (e.g., group created/updated, client connected/disconnected), `file_content_response`, `connected_clients_list`, `error_message`
    *   **Consider:** Define the expected payload structure for *each* message type using the interfaces defined in step 1. This forms the API contract for your WebSocket server.

3.  **Establish the Project Structure and Basic Setup:**
    *   **Why:** You need a place to put your code, manage dependencies, and configure the build process.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Create a dedicated directory for the WebSocket server (e.g., `packages/server` or `server/`).
        *   Initialize a `package.json` (`npm init` or `yarn init`).
        *   Install core dependencies: TypeScript, Node.js types (`@types/node`), and your chosen WebSocket library (e.g., `ws` or `socket.io`).
        *   Set up a `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation.
        *   Create basic source folders (e.g., `src/`).

4.  **Plan the Initial Server State Management Strategy:**
    *   **Why:** How will the server store the `ServerState` (context groups, snippets, client list) in memory? How will it handle concurrent access if multiple clients modify things (even in a single-user scenario, updates need to be serialized)?
    *   **Action:** Decide on the basic in-memory storage approach. Initially, this could be as simple as a single object holding all the state. Think about how updates will be applied and broadcast. You don't need complex databases yet, but acknowledging *how* state is held and modified is key.

**In summary, before writing the first line of server logic:**

1.  **Define *What*:** Solidify the data structures (TypeScript Interfaces).
2.  **Define *How*:** Specify the communication protocol (WebSocket Messages/Events and Payloads).
3.  **Prepare the *Environment*:** Set up the basic project structure and dependencies.
4.  **Plan the *Core Mechanism*:** Outline the in-memory state management approach.

Doing this planning upfront will make the actual implementation much smoother and ensure consistency across your components.
