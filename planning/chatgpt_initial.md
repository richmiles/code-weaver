The very first step is to clearly define and structure the **data model** and the **message protocol** that your WebSocket server will use.  

**Here’s a suggested action plan:**

### 1. Define your data structures (schemas):

- **Contexts**:
  - What metadata does each context group store?
    - Unique identifier (UUID)
    - Name/description
    - List of file references/snippet references
    - Ownership and permissions (for future multi-user extension)
    - Timestamp for creation/updates
    - Token-count estimates

- **Files and snippets**:
  - Path, name, snippet content
  - Associated metadata (size, last-modified, language type)
  - Substructure references (functions, classes, Markdown headings)
  
- **Client state**:
  - User sessions (if supporting multi-user later)
  - Connection status (connected, syncing, disconnected)
  - Client identifiers (VS Code, browser extension, MCP)

### 2. Define the message/event protocol for WebSocket interactions:

- Establish clear messaging for the following scenarios:
  - **Client to server**:
    - Connect/disconnect notifications
    - Context data request ("give me current contexts/snippets")
    - Context data updates ("here are changes I’ve made locally")
    - File operations (initially read-only, but prepare messages for future writes)
  
  - **Server to client**:
    - Initial synchronization of state (when client connects)
    - Real-time updates (new contexts, file updates, snippet changes)
    - Connection status changes (e.g., new client connected, disconnected)
    - Broadcast context updates to all connected clients
  
- Consider error handling and recovery messages as well.

### 3. Document the API:

- Create a clear, simple markdown or JSON schema describing your:
  - Message format (e.g., `{ type: "context:update", payload: {...} }`)
  - Expected responses
  - Event names and their payload formats

### 4. Think through key use-case scenarios:

- Initial client connection and state synchronization
- Real-time file/snippet/context updates
- Future collaboration scenarios (user sessions, permissions)
- Context delivery to external services (like the MCP server or Claude Desktop integration)

### Why start here?

Doing this first ensures a solid foundation for everything that comes after:

- **Avoid wasted work**: Clear data structures and message formats prevent confusion or refactoring later.
- **Scalability**: Thoughtful definitions ensure your server remains extensible as you introduce new features.
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation helps future-you (and potentially collaborators) to quickly understand and extend the codebase.

Once you have these schemas and protocols clearly laid out, you'll have a detailed blueprint for building out your WebSocket server confidently and efficiently.
